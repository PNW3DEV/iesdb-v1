# Genesis Connect for Woothemes Sensei
Plugin wrapper to easily integrate the Woothemes Sensei plugin with the Genesis Framework.

The code for the integration is taken from https://support.woothemes.com/hc/en-us/articles/204428855-StudioPress-Genesis.

In other words, if you are not trying to integrate the Woothemes Sensei plugin with the Genesis Framework and/or one of its child themes, this plugin is pretty much useless for you...

This plugin will only work (i.e. activate) with the Genesis Framework and its child themes.
