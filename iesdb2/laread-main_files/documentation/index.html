                    <p>You can login with your username or email.</p>
                    <p>
                        Please follow along for step by step login instructions:
                        Let’s take a step-by-step tour through your site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please don’t change anything within the program unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, you’ll soon be changing everything.

                        <h2>Login Form</h2>

                        Begin by logging into the “administration area” or the back end of your website. Visit your site’s login page by placing “wp-admin” after your domain name (e.g. http://iesdbraptors.org/wp-admin). You can also place “login”. Now log into the site using your username and password.

                        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
                        After logging in you are on the main Administration Screen called the Dashboard. This is the brain behind your website, the place where you can let your creativity explode, writing brilliant posts and designing the best and most lovely website possible. This is where the organization of your site begins – and this is just the start.
                    </p>

            <div id="post" class="row">
                <section class="doc-block">
                    <h2><i>4</i>Posts</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://iesdbraptors.org/post">Post from frontend.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <p>Now what?</p>

                    <p>Simple. You login to your Administration Screen, and in the navigation menu on the left, click on Posts, and then Add New. WordPress displays the Posts Add New Screen. This Screen allows you to populate your site with actual information! You'll be spending most of your administration time here, so you should spend a bit of time familiarizing yourself with it.</p>

                    <p>Posts are the principal element (or content) of a blog. The Posts are the writings, compositions, discussions, discourses, musings, and, yes, the rantings, of a blog owner and contributors. Posts, in most cases, are the reason a blog exists; without Posts, there is no blog!</p>

                    <h4>All Posts</h4>
                    <p>Via the All Posts Screen you can select the Post or Posts you wish to edit, delete, or view. Multiple Posts can be selected for deletion and for editing. A powerful bulk edit feature allows you to change certain fields, in mass, for a group of Posts. A handy in-line edit tool, called Quick Edit, allows you to update many fields for an individual Post. Various search and filtering options allow you to find the Posts you want to edit or delete.</p>

                    <h4>Add New Post</h4>
                    <p>The most important part of of the site, the Posts Add New Screen is where you write new Posts. While you are writing those Posts, you can also create new Categories and new Tags. In addition, any Media (pictures, video, recordings, files) can be uploaded and inserted into the Posts.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="events" class="row">
                <section class="doc-block">
                    <h2><i>5</i>Events</h2>
                    <p>Event Instructions</p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Creating an event</h4>
                    <p>This is actually really easy. Let’s start in the dashboard – you should be able to find a menu entry called Events and, if you hover over this or click on it, you should see the Add New link.</p>

                    <!-- Showing the Add New item within the Events menu -->

                    <p>Once you’ve found it, go ahead and click on it! This should bring you to the event editor.
                    </p>
                    <p>Just as with a page or post, you can add a title and description to your event. The expected controls for saving it as a draft or publishing it are present, too:
                    </p>
                    <!-- Screenshot showing the event editor in action -->

                    <p>Of course, events have specific bits of information associated with them that most pages and posts don’t require – start and end dates, for instance, not to mention venues and organizers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Fields to set all of these things can be found below the description editor, in an area called the events meta box:
                    </p>
                    <!-- Screenshot of the event editor events meta box -->

                    <p>Let’s look at each of the settings in this area in turn. First, the date and time fields.
                    </p>
                    <p>The All Day Event checkbox is useful when the event is taking place on a particular date (or dates) – but you don’t really know when, or else feel that it is good enough to say it takes place “all day” without being more specific
                    </p>
                    <p>The Start Date & Time is fairly self-explantory – this is simply when the event starts. If you already checked the All Day Event box you will not be able to specify a time – otherwise, of course, you can also pick a time at which the event will start
                    Generally what starts must finish, but that isn’t always the case. Use the End Date & Time fields if there is a defined end time for the event – if there isn’t you can leave the end date and time identical to the start date and time: doing so effectively indicates an open-ended event
                    The above covers creating a regular, non-recurring event. If you need help creating a PRO recurring event, you’ll want to read through our walkthrough tutorial on recurring events.</p>

                    <p>Next, let’s move on to the Event Location Details:
                    </p>
                    <p>Event location (venue) section of the event data meta box
                    </p>
                    <p>The first thing you’ll see in this section is the Use New Venue dropdown. This allows you to select a venue that you created for some previous event … of course, if this is the first time you have used The Events Calendar it is likely to be empty – but it can save you some time when creating events in the future by re-using existing venue details.</p>

                    <p>It’s also worth noting that you don’t need to create (or use) a venue. If you prefer not to specify a venue, simply move on to the next section.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most of the fields are pretty self explanatory – you provide a venue name, optional address details and – if you like – a contact phone number and website. The last two checkboxes control whether a map should be shown to visitors and/or a link to a map should be displayed.
                    </p>
                    <p>If your event is happening a little off the beaten path and there isn’t a mappable address, you can use latitude and longitude instead. To do this, leave the venue without an address. After you’ve created the event, go to Events –> Venues and edit the Venue in question. You’ll see an option there for adding coordinates.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you’re happy with the event’s venue you can move on to the next section: the organizer details.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rather like the venue details, you can select any pre-existing organizer details that you have already entered. Also – just as with the venue details – this area is completely optional.
                    </p>
                    <h4>New Event Organizer
                    </h4>
                    <p>You do not need to provide organizer details and, if you do, you need only provide as much information as you want to. With The Events Calendar 3.11+, you can add multiple organizers to an event. Keep in mind that if you opt for multiple organizers, any organizer meta (like the phone number or email) will not show on the frontend- only the organizer names will be listed. If you have Events Calendar PRO, the listed names will link to the associated Organizer Page.</p>

                    <p>The next section in the New Event Admin let’s you (again, optionally) provide an event website:
                    </p>
                    <!-- Event website field within the event meta box -->

                    <p>This is particularly useful if you are showcasing events organized by external organizations and they have a dedicated event website.
                    </p>
                    <p>Next, let’s look at the event cost fields:
                    </p>
                    <!-- Cost fields in the event editor -->

                    <p>Once again you can pass on by and leave these alone if you like. If you don’t provide a cost, then no cost details will be shown to visitors. If the event is actually free then simply provide a cost of 0 (zero).
                    </p>
                    <p>Do also note that, in the interests of being as internationally friendly as possible, you are able to make a currency symbol display either before or after the actual amount.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Don’t leave just yet, there is still lots to explore!
                    </h5>
                    <!-- <p><h4>TAXONOMIES</h4>
                    </p>
                    This is a really useful feature: let’s say you have some blog posts about the laws of physics and are also promoting a series of events – lectures, perhaps – about the same thing. You can tag both with a suitable term like Physics and help visitors to the website find not only physics-related posts but events, too!

                    Tagging meta box - identical to the post editor tag box used in regular WP posts

                    Besides tags, you can also categorize events:

                    Event categories selection box

                    It is worth emphasizing, though, that these are not the same family of categories as used in posts. They definitely have a very similar (in fact, identical) user interface to regular post categories – but they are in fact a distinct family of categories.

                    In other words, if you happen to have an existing category you use for blog posts, you should not expect it to appear in the list of event categories – and if it does, well, it just happens to share the same name (but isn’t actually the same). -->

                    <p><h4>EVENT OPTIONS
                    </h4></p>
                    <p>Usually found close to the tag and event category meta boxes, you can find the Event Options:
                    </p>
                    <!-- Extra event options found in the event editor -->

                    <p>Sometimes you want to be able to link to an event post (by email, or directly via a menu) but would prefer it isn’t included in the main event views – checking the Hide from Event Listings box accomplishes just that
                    You might also happen to have a whole load of events taking place on the same day … naturally that can cause some problems in month view – and so, at least by default, no more than 3 events per day are shown in that view – selecting Sticky in Calendar View helps you to ensure that this event is one of the ones that do show.</p>

                    <p>Media is the images, video, recordings, and files, you upload and use in your blog. Media is typically uploaded and inserted into the content when writing a Post or Page. Note that the Uploading Files section in the Settings Media Screen describes the location and structure of the upload directory.</p>

                    <h4>Library</h4>
                    <p>The Media Library Screen allows you edit, delete or view Media previously uploaded to your blog. Multiple Media objects can be selected for deletion. Search and filtering ability is also provided to allow you to find the desired Media.</p>

                    <h4>Add New Media</h4>
                    <p>The Media Add New Screen allows you to upload new media to later use with posts and pages. A Flash Uploader is provided and the ability to use a Browser Uploader is supplied if the Flash Uploader does not work.</p>

                    <h4>Edit Media</h4>
                    <p>The Edit Media page allows you to edit the information (title, caption, alt text, etc.) of media files uploaded to your site. This page does not appear as a link in the main Dashboard navigation, but is reached by clicking on the Edit link in the Media Library Screen that appears when you hover over each item, or when uploading media for the first time on th Media Add New Screen once your upload has completed.</p>

                    <h4>Categories</h4>
                    <p>Every Post is filed under one or more Categories. Categories allow the classification of your Posts into groups and subgroups, thereby aiding viewers in the navigation and use of your site.</p>

                    <p>Each Category may be assigned to a Category Parent so that you may set up a hierarchy within the category structure. Using automobiles as an example, a hierarchy might be Car->Ford->Mustang. In creating categories, recognize that each category name must be unique, regardless of hierarchy.</p>

                    <p>When using the site, all the Categories to which a given post belongs are displayed under that post. When someone viewing your blog clicks on one of those Category links, a archive page with all the Posts belonging to that Category will be displayed.</p>

                    <p>The Posts Categories Screen allows you to add, edit, and delete Categories, as well as organize your categories hierarchically. Multiple Categories can be selected for deletion. A search option allows you to find the Categories you want to edit or delete. Also remember Categories can be added in the Posts Add New Screen.</p>

                    <p>
                        The CRM is made simple. For usage: login to the <a href="https://iesdbraptors.org/dashboard">/dashboard</a> > WP CRM System (Left Menu). Here you have a few options:

                    <p>
                        Feel free to use this however, you please. All of the options work very similar, they just allow you to organize your work in different work-flows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll begin by adding a contact. Go to Contacts > Add. You'll have a list of fields you can document your students information in. At the bottom of the page there will be a large rich text editor to allow you to write freely as well as upload docs/pics. Last but not least, you need to click "Publish" to save this contact to the CRM. (PLEASE NOTE: This does NOT post to the site. This is only saving the contact to your admin-dashboard CRM)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you move onto tasks/projects you'll have the ability to assign tasks/projects to individuals/organizations and/or a contact/student. You can set start and end dates as well as use the rich text editor to document additional information.

                        When in doubt, power cycling is your first step! This means disconnect from power, in your case, you're using software on the web so you will need to log off the site and clear the browser cookies/tokens. You can do this (if using chrome) by going to Settings > Show Advanced Settings (at the bottom) > Privacy > Content Settings > All Cookies and Site Data > Remove All <b>OR</b> type in iesdbraptors.org > Click the X.

                        A faster way to do this is to clear/flush the cache on the site. Go to /dashboard > Account Settings in top toolbar > Flush Cache.

                    <p>To change user avatar/photo (seen on staff/author box, author archive page or author page template etc. ) you have two options:</p>
                    <ol class="doc-list doc-list-thin" style="padding-right: 0;">
                        <li>Go to Users > All Users > Edit User > Scroll to Bottom > Upload/Ad Photo</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="list-caption">How does the site work with screen readers?</p>
                    <p>We do this with something called ARIA! ARIA is a set of special accessibility attributes which can be added to any markup, but is especially suited to HTML. The role attribute defines what the general type of object is (such as an article, alert, or slider). Additional ARIA attributes provide other useful properties, such as a description for a form or the current value of a progressbar.</p>

                    <p>ARIA is implemented in most popular browsers and screen readers. However, implementations vary and older technologies don't support it well (if at all). Use either "safe" ARIA that degrades gracefully, or ask users to upgrade to newer technology. </p>
                    <ol class="doc-list doc-list-thin" style="padding-right: 0;">
                        <li>Use cases: Media Uploads - Go to '/dashboard' > Media > Add Media/Media Library > Add/Edit Photo > ALT Text. Use the alt text field to display information about the image for user with screen readers. </li>
